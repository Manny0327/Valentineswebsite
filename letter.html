                My dearest Ashley,
            </p>
            <p class="letter-text">
                HAPPY 6 MONTH ANNIVERSARY!!. My love, it is an understatement to say that I have loved every single moment we have spent together. You are special to me beyond words can even describe. I love you tremendously and more than you can ever imagine. It has been half a year since we got together, and close to a year since we first met. And I have been nothing but grateful since, you are truly a blessing, and I don’t think I could've asked for anything more. I am grateful to have been able to spend this time with you, for the love I have for you is eternal and shall surpass lifetimes. We won’t see each other till June, and that truly saddens me, but I find peace in knowing that this is only a fraction of our time together, and we will have much more time to spend. While the distance may separate us now, my love for you continues to grow as the days pass. Our FaceTime calls, and every time I am able to hear you through my headphones, it enriches my day. Your beautiful voice that I can hear talk for hours on end. Your beautiful eyes that mesmerize me every time I look at them. It is as if I am staring at the most beautiful piece of art in the world. I can go on and on about the things I love about you. Your bangs that make you look so incredibly gorgeous. The fact that you’re incredibly hilarious, and I wish I could spend all my time laughing with you. One of my favorite things about you is your laughter; it is so contagious and makes me incredibly happy just to see you laugh. I love you so much, Ashley, no amount of words can put it into perspective.

                Loving you was so easy, ever since the first day you messaged me. It was like we clicked, I didn’t feel like I had to force a conversation with you. We talked for so long, and without pause. I was scared at first to meet you, because I didn’t know if things would change in person. Luckily it didn't. We still were able to make conversation so easily that it didn’t feel forced in the slightest. Everything when it came to you was just so easy, knowing I liked you was easy. I felt it so soon, but I knew that there was only one girl I wanted in my life, and it was you. Every moment after that I knew I wanted to be your boyfriend there was never a doubt in my mind that said otherwise. I loved it when we went to try to watch Interstellar for the first time, and it got ruined by the rain. At least the movie did, but it didn’t ruin my time with you, I had so much fun that day it was one of my favorite days ever. It was also the first time we held hands. Or when we went to the museum of moving images, we explored a new place together and took some memorable photos and I loved every moment with you. My love I want to express one more time that I love you. Happy 6 month anniversary again. I hope we are able to see each other soon, so I could give you the biggest hug in the world. Too many more that will come. You are the sun to my earth, as you always make my day bright no matter where I am.
